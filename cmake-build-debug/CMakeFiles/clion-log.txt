CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:40 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindKlampt.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Klampt", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Klampt" with any
  of the following names:

    KlamptConfig.cmake
    klampt-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Klampt" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Klampt_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Klampt"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
